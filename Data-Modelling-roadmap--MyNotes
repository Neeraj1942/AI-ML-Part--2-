Data Preparation ->
1.Data Division         -> splitting into test and train data
2.Data Cleaning         -> a. Removing invalid values, b.Imputing missing vales, c.Treating outliers
3.Data Reconstruction   -> converting data from one format to another
4.Data Transformation   -> combining data from multiple sources to easily analyze and work it
5.Feature Engineering   -> a.creating new features by combining existing ones, b. required domain knowledge

Modelling -> uses different machine learning algorithms and train the prepared dataset
mainly 3 types ->
a. Classification model
b. Regression model
c. Unsupervised machine learning model

Model Evaluation -> we measure the models correctness using the eavaluation metrics ->
a. Mean squared error 
b. Root mean squared error 
c. Accuracy 
d. Precision
e. Recall
to check the model realibility on the models unseen data(eg - test data)

Model Deployment ->
this steps involves the trained and evaluated model is deployed or integrated into eco-system (server , web-aplication, app)

Feed back loop -> to ensure the model is working fine checking it regularly.
