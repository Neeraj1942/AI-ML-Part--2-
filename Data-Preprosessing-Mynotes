#reading the Pos_Data and using parse_dates to interpret Date column as dates
pos = pd.read_excel("POS_Data.xlsx", parse_dates=['Date'])
pos.head()

parse_dates = ['Date'] -> converts the 'date' column from strings into proper datetime64[ns] objects,
this is used to enable pandas to read the date column as date
example of ythis object - >
date	       value
2023-01-01	  100
2023-01-02	  120

pos.describe
Explanation ->
Row	                        Meaning
count	        Number of non-null (non-missing) values in that column
mean	        The average (sum of values ÷ count)
std	          Standard deviation — how spread out the values are from the mean
min	          The smallest value in the column
25%	          The 25th percentile (1st quartile) — 25% of data is below this
50%	          The median (50th percentile) — half of the data is below this
75%	          The 75th percentile (3rd quartile) — 75% of data is below this
max	          The largest value in the column

pos.describe(include='O') -> here 'O' stands for objects, so it means include the objects also
->
count: Non-null values — all are present (no missing data).
unique: Number of distinct values in the column.
top: The most frequent (mode) value.
freq: How many times the top value appears.
